The Noble Sūtra Teaching the Eleven Perceptions]

Homage to the Three Jewels!

Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was dwelling in the dwelling in the Grove of Twin
Sāl-Trees in the vicinity of the Malla town of Kuśinagara. As the time came for his mahāparinirvāṇa,
he addressed the monks:

“O monks, at the time of death, a monk should engender the eleven perceptions. What are these
eleven? They are:

The perception of non-attachment to this lifeThe perception of love for all beingsThe perception
of relinquishing all grudgesThe perception of confessing all debauched disciplineThe
perception of genuinely taking all the vows of disciplineThe perception of lightness towards
even major wrongdoingThe perception of greatness towards even minor roots of virtueThe
perception of fearlessness towards the next worldThe perception of impermanence towards all
conditioned thingsThe perception of selflessness toward all phenomenaThe perception of understanding
nirvāṇa to be peace

As soon as the Blessed One had said this, all the monks rejoiced and praised the words of the
Blessed One. This completes Teaching the Eleven Perceptions, the final testament of the
Blessed One.
